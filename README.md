Hello,

This is my profile I am a 3rd year computer science major, interested Software Engineering/development and AI. I have done face recognition with AI internship and how worked with Libraries like numpy, pandas, MTCNN, facenet, speech_recogntion all with pythorch. 

I am very curious about large language models and I want to learn more about them. I am very positive about the future of AI and machine learning. I am also studying cloud as I think it is the future. Cloud is also very intersting for me.
